<p style="font-family: Arial">Biography: Fiction, Fact and Form. New York: St. Martin's Press, 1984. $25.00 Ira Bruce Nadel's historical, critical, and theoretical study of biography, the end product of much thought and frequent publication by him on the subject, bears the interesting, alliterative, and revealing subtitle "Fiction, Fact and Form.History has renewed its dialogue with biography when it departed from the
long duration, from living history to micro-history — the microstoria school
of Carlo Ginzburg and Giovanni Levi. Grounding her reflection on a new
reading of the works of pre-modernist thinkers like Herder, Droysen, and
Dilthey, Sabina Loriga offers a very convincing advocacy of “l’histoire
biographique” [14] in Le Petit x. De la biographie à l’histoire (2010). In sociology,
the followers of what Mauss used to call a “phenomenology of the
individual,” via the participative methods of the Chicago School and Mass
Observation, have fostered the use of the “récits de vie” as a methodology in
several domains, developing into life-writing studies, which have become a
quasi-discipline in their own right, especially in the United States and the
United Kingdom."</p>
